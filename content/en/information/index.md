        Hello! My name is Taehos Park, and I am currently studying Computer Science at Chonbuk National University. I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence, web development, and data analysis, and I have been building my skills through various projects.

        So far, I have participated in multiple web development projects and AI-related research, including the development of a blog platform, implementation of a bulletin board system, and the creation of a news article crawling system. Additionally, I took part in an ideathon competition organized by Jeonju ICT Innovation Square, where I honed my creative problem-solving skills.

        My current goal is to obtain certifications such as the technical certification, the Korean history certification, and to achieve a TOEIC score of 900 before graduating. Ultimately, I aim to become a public servant in the IT field. To meet these goals, I have been actively participating in various projects and practices to gain practical experience. For example, I have recently been involved in team projects to improve my collaboration skills and have explored the fusion of artificial intelligence and web development to expand my expertise across diverse fields.

        I believe that skills like project management, problem-solving, and continuous learning of the latest technology trends are crucial for future success. These experiences will be invaluable in achieving my long-term goals.
