Hello! My name is Taeho Park, and I am currently studying Computer Science at Chonbuk National University. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, web development, and data analysis, and I am building my skills through various projects. So far, I have worked on several web development projects and AI-related research, including blog platform development, implementing a bulletin board system, and creating a news article crawling system. Additionally, I participated in the Ideathon competition organized by Jeonju ICT Innovation Square, where I developed my creative problem-solving skills. I am eager to continue improving my skills and taking on new challenges across various fields.
